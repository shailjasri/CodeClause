A brain tumor is a growth of abnormal cells in the brain. The anatomy of the brain is very complex, with different parts responsible for different nervous system. Brain Tumor can develop in any part of the brain or skull, including its protective lining, the underside of the brain(skull base), the brainstem, the sinuses and the nasal cavity, and many other areas.
Brain tumors can be cancerous(malignant) or noncancerous(benign).When benign or malignant tumors grow, they can cause the pressure inside skull to increase. This can cause brain damage, and it can be life-threating.
However, Early detection and classification of brain tumors is an important research domain in the field of medical imaging and accordingly helps in selecting the most convenient treatment method to save patient life.
